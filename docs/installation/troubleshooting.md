## Issue #1: "No module named 'structlog'"

### Error Message You See

```
Failed to initialize LLM service: No module named 'structlog'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'
```

### What This Means

Python is looking for a package called `structlog`, but it's not installed.

### Most Common Cause

❌ **You skipped Step 8**: Did not run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### How to Fix It

**Step 1**: Make sure you're in the virtual environment (you should see `(venv)` in your prompt)

**Step 2**: Run this command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3**: Wait 3-5 minutes for it to finish

**Step 4**: Verify it worked:

```bash
pip list | grep structlog
```

You should see `structlog 23.2.0` or similar.

**Step 5**: Try starting Piper Morgan again:

```bash
python main.py
```

✅ Should work now!

## Issue #2: "command not found: python3"

### Error Message You See

```
command not found: python3
```

### What This Means

Your computer doesn't recognize the `python3` command.

### Possible Causes

1. Python is not installed
2. Python is installed but not in the system path
3. You're using the wrong command name

### How to Fix It

**First, check if Python is installed at all**:

**Mac/Linux**:

```bash
which python
```

or

```bash
which python3
```

**Windows**:

```bash
where python
```

**If it says "not found"**: Python is not installed. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) and install Python 3.12.

**If you see a path like `/usr/bin/python3`**: Python IS installed. Try these alternatives:

Option 1 - Try `python` instead of `python3`:

```bash
python --version
```

Option 2 - If that doesn't work, reinstall Python:

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Download Python 3.12
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Close your terminal completely
7. Open a NEW terminal and try again

## Issue #3: "command not found: git"

### Error Message You See

```
command not found: git
```

### What This Means

Git is not installed on your computer.

### How to Fix It

**Mac**:

1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `xcode-select --install`
3. Click "Install" when prompted
4. Wait ~10 minutes
5. Close Terminal
6. Open NEW Terminal and try again

**Windows**:

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Click "Download for Windows"
3. Run the installer
4. Click "Next" through all screens
5. At the end, make sure "Launch Git Bash" is checked
6. Click "Finish"
7. Close your Command Prompt
8. Open NEW Command Prompt and try again

## Issue #4: Virtual Environment Not Activating

### What Happens

You run the activation command but don't see `(venv)` in your prompt.

### How to Fix It

**Check 1: Are you in the right folder?**

You should be in the `piper-morgan` folder. Type:

```bash
pwd
```

You should see something ending in `piper-morgan`.

If not, navigate there:

```bash
cd ~/piper-morgan-workspace/piper-morgan
```

**Check 2: Try the activation command again**

**Mac/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Check 3: If still not working, recreate the virtual environment**

```bash
rm -rf venv          # Remove the old one
python3 -m venv venv # Create a new one
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate (Mac/Linux)
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate (Windows)
```

anthropic_api_key: "sk-ant-xxx..."
```

(Use your actual key, keep the quotes)

**Step 5**: Save the file and close

**Step 6**: Start Piper Morgan again:

## Issue #6: "Address already in use"

### Error Message You See

```
Address already in use: ('127.0.0.1', 8001)
```

### What This Means

Piper Morgan is already running in another terminal window.

### How to Fix It

**Option 1**: Close the other terminal

1. Look for another Terminal/Command Prompt window that has Piper Morgan running
2. Close that window
3. Try starting Piper Morgan again

**Option 2**: If you can't find the other window, wait 30 seconds and try again

**Option 3**: Restart your computer (nuclear option but always works)

## Issue #7: "Permission denied"

### Error Message You See

```
Permission denied
chmod: cannot access
```

### What This Means

Your computer won't let you run or modify a file.

### How to Fix It (Mac/Linux)

This usually happens on the venv activation. Try this:

```bash
chmod +x venv/bin/activate
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Issue #8: "pip: command not found"

### Error Message You See

```
command not found: pip
```

### What This Means

pip is not installed or not in your PATH.

### How to Fix It

**Check 1**: Are you in the virtual environment?

You should see `(venv)` in your prompt. If not:

**Mac/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Check 2**: If you still see "pip: command not found"

Try using Python to run pip:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Issue #9: "ImportError" or "ModuleNotFoundError" (Other Packages)

### Error Message You See

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
ImportError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'
```

### What This Means

Some Python package is missing.

### How to Fix It

99% of the time, this means you didn't run Step 8. Run it now:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait for it to complete, then try again:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Issue #10: Slow Download During "pip install -r requirements.txt"

### What Happens

The installation is taking forever (more than 10 minutes).

### Is This Normal?

It depends on your internet speed. 3-5 minutes is normal. If it's taking much longer:

**Option 1**: Be patient! It might just be slow internet.

**Option 2**: Check if your internet is working:

```bash
ping google.com
```

If it says "command not found" (Windows) or hangs, your internet might be down.

**Option 3**: Cancel and try again

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop, wait 10 seconds, then run again:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Issue #11: Getting Errors with Red Text During Installation

### What Happens

You see lots of red error messages during `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Is This Normal?

**Usually yes!** Red text during pip install is often just warnings. Let it finish.

### When It's a Problem

Only if the process STOPS and returns to the prompt **without installing all packages**.

If that happens:

1. Scroll up to see the actual error (before the red warnings)
2. Copy the error message
3. Report it (it might be a network issue)

---

## Issue #12: Can't Remember Where I Put Piper Morgan

### How to Find It

**Mac/Linux**:

```bash
find ~ -name "piper-morgan" -type d
```

**Windows**:
Use File Explorer:

1. Click "This PC"
2. Use the search box in the top-right
3. Search for "piper-morgan"

Once you find it, remember the path for next time.

## Issue #13: "Python 3.9" But I Installed 3.12

### What Happens

You installed Python 3.12, but `python3 --version` still shows 3.9.

### What This Means

You probably have multiple Python versions installed. Your system is using an older one.

### How to Fix It

**Mac/Linux**:

Try using the full path to Python 3.12:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv
```

Or find where Python 3.12 was installed:

```bash
which python3.12
```

**Windows**:

Use the Python launcher:

```bash
py -3.12 -m venv venv
```

## Issue #14: Getting Different Error Than Listed

### What to Do

1. **Read the error carefully** - it often tells you what's wrong
2. **Search the error online** - Google it (seriously, often helps!)
3. **Take a screenshot** of the full error
4. **Note**:
   - What step you were on
   - Your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
   - Your Python version (`python3 --version`)
   - Your macOS/Windows version

---

## General Troubleshooting Steps

**When stuck, try these in order**:

1. **Read the error** - It's usually telling you what's wrong
2. **Try again** - Sometimes network glitches cause failures
3. **Check prerequisites** - Did you install Python and Git?
4. **Check virtual environment** - Do you see `(venv)` in your prompt?
5. **Try Step 8 again** - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **Restart your terminal** - Close and open a new one
7. **Restart your computer** - If nothing else works
8. **Ask for help** - Copy the error message and report it
