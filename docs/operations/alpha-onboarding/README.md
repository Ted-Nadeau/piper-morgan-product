## Sending Checklist

Before sending pre-qualification:
- [ ] Personalize name
- [ ] Verify technical claims match current version

Before sending confirmation:
- [ ] Schedule setup call first
- [ ] Attach current documentation from `docs/`:
  - ALPHA_TESTING_GUIDE.md
  - ALPHA_AGREEMENT_v2.md
  - ALPHA_QUICKSTART.md
  - ALPHA_KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- [ ] Update internal tracking (who's in alpha cohort)

---

## Notes

**Email Tone**: Friendly but honest about alpha status. Set realistic expectations upfront.

**Support Commitment**: Only promise what you can deliver. Small cohort (2-5) is manageable for close support.

**Technical Prerequisites**: Don't sugarcoat - command line comfort is required. Better to filter out now than frustrate later.
