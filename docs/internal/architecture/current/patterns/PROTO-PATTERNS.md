# Proto-Pattern Tracking

_Candidates for formalization that need additional evidence before full pattern status._

**Purpose**: Track emerging practices that have been observed but not yet proven across multiple instances. Proto-patterns graduate to full patterns when they meet the evidence threshold (typically 2+ additional instances beyond initial observation).

**Review cadence**: Evaluated during 6-week pattern sweeps. Proto-patterns that meet evidence threshold get promoted; those with no new instances after two sweeps get archived.

## Active Proto-Patterns

### PP-001: Design Archaeology

**Observed**: February 3, 2026 (Pattern Sweep 2.0, #777)
**Source**: History sidebar design investigation (February 2, 2026)
**CIO Decision**: Deferred to proto-pattern tracking (February 4, 2026)
**Elevation Criteria**: 2+ additional instances before March 17, 2026 sweep

**Description**: When investigating a design question, conduct archaeological analysis of how the current design evolved before proposing changes. Examines commit history, omnibus logs, and decision records to understand *why* the current state exists — preventing accidental reversal of intentional decisions.

**Known Instance**:
1. History sidebar 404 investigation (#780) — discovered that sidebar design had evolved through 3 distinct phases, each responding to different user feedback. Without archaeology, the fix would have reverted to Phase 1 design.

**What Would Make This a Pattern**:
- Additional instances of design archaeology preventing regressions
- Evidence that skipping archaeology led to problems (negative instances)
- Distinct enough from Pattern-042 (Investigation-Only Protocol) to warrant separate documentation

**Related Patterns**:
- Pattern-042: Investigation-Only Protocol (investigation discipline, but not design-specific)
- Pattern-060: Cascade Investigation (investigation breadth, not historical depth)

## Archived Proto-Patterns

_Proto-patterns that were not elevated after two sweep cycles._

### Historical (Pre-Tracking)

The following were identified informally but never tracked with this mechanism:

- **Primate in the Loop** — Human oversight pattern (December 2025). Subsumed by existing patterns (006, 047).
- **Small Scripts Win** — Preference for small focused scripts (December 2025). Too general to be a pattern.
- **Session Failure Conditions** — Conditions that cause session failures (December 2025). Covered by STOP conditions in CLAUDE.md.

## Process

### Adding a Proto-Pattern

1. Identify candidate during pattern sweep or ad-hoc observation
2. Verify it's genuinely distinct from existing patterns (FALSE POSITIVE test)
3. Add entry to Active Proto-Patterns with: observation date, source, known instances, elevation criteria
4. Set review date (next scheduled sweep)

### Elevating a Proto-Pattern

1. During pattern sweep, review active proto-patterns for new instances
2. If evidence threshold met: draft full pattern document, submit for CIO approval
3. Move entry from Active to the main pattern index
4. Remove from this file

### Archiving a Proto-Pattern

1. If no new instances after two sweep cycles (~12 weeks), archive
2. Move to Archived section with brief explanation
3. Can be reactivated if new evidence surfaces
