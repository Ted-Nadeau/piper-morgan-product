JSON_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a document and must provide a structured summary in JSON format.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON - no additional text, explanations, or markdown

  * NO Unicode bullet characters (•, ●, ◦) anywhere in the content
- All text content should be clean and readable

IMPORTANT: key_findings and points MUST be arrays of strings, NOT single strings!

Required JSON structure:
{{
  "title": "Document title or main topic",
  "document_type": "Type of document (report, specification, guide, etc.)",
  "key_findings": [
    "Important finding 1",
    "Important finding 2",

    }}
  ]

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT vs INCORRECT:
✓ CORRECT: "key_findings": ["Finding 1", "Finding 2", "Finding 3"]
✗ INCORRECT: "key_findings": "• Finding 1 • Finding 2 • Finding 3"
